### 2.5 Learn Page

The Learn page consists of a chatbot called RoboGram that you can use to get up to speed with how to draw a sentence diagram and the various components that the structure of a sentence entails.

![learn-1](../img/guide/learn-1.png)

#### 2.5.0 RoboGram

Click a prompt button on in the chat box to use RoboGram and information about what you clicked will show up in the chat box.

![learn-4](../img/guide/learn-4.png)
_Figure 2.0 - prompt buttons circled in red_

![learn-2](../img/guide/learn-2.png)
_Figure 2.1 - button clicked and response circled in red_

![learn-3](../img/guide/learn-3.png)
_Figure 2.2 - button clicked and response circled in red_

There are various examples that are shown in the learn page. Each example is the sentence followed by its respect sentence diagram image which contain indicators of the different parts of the sentence to help you know how where to place the different sentences in the sentence diagram.

![learn-5](../img/guide/learn-5.png)
_Figure 2.1 - button clicked and response circled in red_

### 2.6 Canvas

#### 2.6.0 Basics

The canvas offers a wide range of functionality for a user to draw a sentence diagram.

The canvas consists of a top panel of buttons and interactive elements, the main canvas screen, and a bottom panel of interactive elements.
![top-canvas](../img/guide/top-canvas.png)
_Figure 2.2.1 - top panel of canvas_

![main-canvas](../img/guide/main-canvas.png)
_Figure 2.2.2- main canvas_

![bottom-canvas](../img/guide/bottom-canvas.png)
_Figure 2.2.3 - bottom panel of canvas_

The bottom panel consists of three buttons that also make edits to the canvas. These are the 'Clear' 'Undo', 'Redo' buttons.

The 'Clear' button, removes all lines and words from the canvas.

![canvas-2](../img/guide/canvas-2.png)
_Figure 2.2.4 - bottom panel of canvas_

The 'Undo' button removes the line that was previously drawn onto the canvas and if there is a word or are words on the line, the word(s) will also be removed with it.

The 'Redo' button redraws the line that was removed by way of 'Undo', and puts back the word(s) that were associated with this line.

![undo-redo](../img/guide/quiz-canvas-4.png)
_Figure 2.2.5 - bottom panel of canvas_

These elements vary between the drawing page and the quiz page. For details for the repspective canvases (see [Canvas](#26-canvas))

#### 2.6.1 Tool Box

The tool box contains buttons that you are supposed to use when drawing the line structures for the sentence diagram.

![toolbox](../img/guide/toolbox.png)

It is located in the top right corner outside of the canvas, as shown in the images below.

![toolbox](../img/guide/toolbox.png)

| Button             | Image                                          | Fucntionality                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Subject            | ![subject](../img/guide/subject.png)           | Draws a subject line                      |
| Predicate          | ![predicate](../img/guide/predicate.png)       | Draws a predicate line structure          |
| Modifier           | ![modifier](../img/guide/modifier.png)         | Draws a modifer line                      |
| Object             | ![object](../img/guide/object.png)             | Draws a object line structure             |
| Subject Compliment | ![subject-comp](../img/guide/subject-comp.png) | Draws a subject compliment line structure |
| Preposition        | ![preposition](../img/guide/preposition.png)   | Draws a preposition line strucuture       |

Please Note that to add a Modifier or a Predicate, one of the horizontal lines must be selected to indicate which line will be attached to it.

#### 2.6.2 Adding Words

Once a line is drawn, a word in the sentence can be dragged and dropped into an allocated spot on any of the lines of the sentence. See images below to see how this works
![canvas-7](../img/guide/canvas-7.png)

- when a word is dragged, rectangluar boxes pop up to show all possible placements of this word.

![canvas-6](../img/guide/canvas-6.png)

- shows a word that has been placed into an allocated box

alternatively, if you would like to replace the word that is in a particular slot, you can drag and drop a new word in their and this should replace the word that is in that slot.

![draw-canvas-4](../img/guide/draw-canvas-4.png)

![draw-canvas-1](../img/guide/draw-canvas-6.png)

#### 2.6.4 Quiz Canvas

The quiz canvas contains different elements to help the user navigate through different sentences consecutively.

The quiz canvas has a circle which indicates the number of your current sence and also indicates how many sentences there are in the quiz overall.

![quiz-canvas-1](../img/guide/quiz-canvas-1.png)

This helps you keep track of your progress. This is located in the top left of the page above the canvas and beside the sentence as shwon in the image below.

![quiz-canvas-6](../img/guide/quiz-canvas-6.png)

The quiz canvas also has a score element which shows how accurate the sentence diagramming that a user is drawing in real time. Alternatively, the user may refresh the score by pressing the refesh button which is located beside the score number.
